Q1. What is the minimum number of states you need for this FSM?
		The minimum number of states needed is 2 since it is a binary counter when CE = 1, and when CE = 0, output does not change

Q2. What is the relation between the state and the output? (ie are they
 always the same value or different)
	when in binary counter state output changes, else it doesnt change

Q3. What are the first 10 values of “Register 2” in the first 10 cycles?
 	0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34


Q4. What operation or function does this FSM perform?
	fibonachi sequence was generated. 
Q5. Write a C program that does the same operation or function and
 returns the value stored in “Register 2” as a function of the number of
 clock ticks since the FSM started.
	

#include "stdio.h" 


int main()
{
	
int reg1 = 1, reg2 = 0;
	
int tickCount, sum;

	
printf ("Enter number of clock ticks\n");
	
scanf("%d", &tickCount);

	
while (tickCount > 1)
	
{	
		
	sum = reg1 + reg2;
		
	reg2 = reg1;
		
	reg1 = sum;
		
	tickCount--;
	
}

	
reg2 = sum;
return reg2;
